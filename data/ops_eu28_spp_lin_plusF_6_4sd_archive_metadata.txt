Input data for paper: Drivers of the changing abundance of European birds at two spatial scales

Species time-series derived from national population estimates and national population trends in the Article 12 reporting dataset


species: species scientific name following HBW and BirdLife International 2019	
year:		year
.id:		Cut-off for the proportion of a species' population to have national trends given in Article 12 reporting for the species level time-series to be estimated. 	
total_pop:	Deterministic estimate of the number of breeding individuals of a species in the EU in a given year across countries where trend data was available	
gmean.x:	Mean of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year across countries where trend data was available
med:		Median of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year across countries where trend data was available
lci:		2.5% of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year across countries where trend data was available	
uci:		97.5% of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year across countries where trend data was available
gmean.y:	Total estimated EU breeding population from Article 12 reporting		
extrap_to:	Extrapolation factor to go from number of birds in the countries with trend estiamtes available to the full EU population	
total_pop_extrap:	Deterministic estimate of the number of breeding individuals of a species in the EU in a given year extrapolated to total EU population
gmean.x_extrap:		Mean of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year extrapolated to total EU population
med_extrap:		Median of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year extrapolated to total EU population
lci_extrap:		2.5% of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year across extrapolated to total EU population
uci_extrap:		97.5% of bootstrapped estimates of the number of breeding inidivduals of a species in the in the EU in a given year across extrapolated to total EU population
